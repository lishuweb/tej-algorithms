# Recursion part 2

Write functions to solve recursion problems

_Difficulty: Medium-to-Hard_

1. [Watch the lecture video](https://learn.fullstackacademy.com/workshop/5a97083f970d1c0004636a5b/content/5a9712d45eac960004036c25/text)
2. Do the practice problems that come after the lecture video (look at the `Readme` tab in codepen to see the problem definition)
   1. [Array sum](https://codepen.io/FullstackAcademy/pen/dmMOEy?editors=0010)
   2. [All systems go](https://codepen.io/FullstackAcademy/pen/xWVRoe?editors=0010)
   3. [The truth counts](https://codepen.io/FullstackAcademy/pen/GxZrEm?editors=0010)
   4. [Get longest name](https://codepen.io/FullstackAcademy/pen/WzwROJ?editors=0010)
   5. [Search party](https://codepen.io/FullstackAcademy/pen/pLyRwx?editors=0010)
3. You can refer to the solution code and / or solution video if you need help. But make sure you REALLY understand it, and that you can solve it without looking at the solution again
4. Git commit it to the `submission` branch with names like `arraySum-rushil.js`
