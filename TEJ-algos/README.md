# REACTO

- **R**epeat: state the problem to check comprehension
- **E**xamples: consider possible use and edge cases
- **A**pproach: state strategy for accomplishing goal
- **C**ode: implement strategy in a written program
- **T**est: check that example cases pass correctly
- **O**ptimize: discuss ways of improving performance

â€¦is a strategy for handling whiteboard-style coding interviews and basic problem solving. This repo contains sample REACTO problems to prepare students for onsite interviews.

## Repo Structure

Each problem will go in its own directory containing the following:

- Required: a README.md
  - Thoroughly defines/states the problem in a way that can be sent directly to students
  - Optional but recommended: problem metadata
    - Difficulty: _easy_, _medium_, _hard_
    - Log of each date/cohort the problem was used for
- Optional but recommended: a JavaScript solution file
  - Implements at least one working solution
  - Is well-commented, highlights core concepts (e.g. recursion, OOP)
  - Includes any sample variables that may be required to test it

## Submitting solutions

- Clone this repository
- For each problem, generally during class, you might only get through the psudo code / analysis phase
- On your commute home please think through the code solution
- Spend some time at home to code and submit the solution
  - git checkout `submission` branch
  - **_create your submission file_**: if the problem folder is `balancedBrackets`, then your filename will be like `balancedBrackets-rushil.js`
  - write a few test cases, including edge cases
  - code your solution
  - run your solution through the test cases
  - commit, and push
- You can refer to the solution in the JavaScript solution file, where available, but only look after you have struggled to come up with the solution. make sure you understand the solution, otherwise ask!
